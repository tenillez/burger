# Must Love Burgers

This app is not deployed to Heroku yet.  It is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

You will see two columns.  On the left side are available burgers to eat.  On the right side are burgers that have been devoured.

Here you are able to add burgers to the available list.
